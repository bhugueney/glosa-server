## Origin

A Glosa is a **Spanish word**. It is defined as a **note**, usually brief, that is **written in the margin of a text** or even between its lines with the intention of clarifying some idea of it. 

The software was born with the **intention that the author's static blog would no longer depend on an external company** (Disqus), and could have control of its content. To make it as easy as possible to deploy, develop and maintain; he programmed in **Clojure**. And from the beginning it was clear to him that he didn't need a conventional database, **plain text was enough**.

## Run

1) Make sure you have Java installed.

2) Create a file `config.yaml` with the following content. You can also use `config.yaml.example` as a base config and change it to fit your needs.

``` yaml
# General
debug: true
domain: localhost
port: 4000
domain-cli: example-cli.com
# Notify
notify: email
subject: New comment
from: server@example.com
to: user@example.com
# SMTP, only notify: email
smtp-host: smtp.example.com
smtp-user: smtpuser
smtp-password: smtppassword
smtp-port: 25
smtp-tls: true
# Captcha
captcha: time
# Database
database: plain
```

3) Download the latest version of Glosa (`glosa-{version}-standalone.jar`).

https://github.com/glosa/glosa-server/releases


4) Now you can execute glosa.

```sh
java -jar target/glosa-{version}-standalone.jar
```

Great ðŸŽ‰. You already have your ðŸ”¥ own comment server ðŸ”¥.

That's it, now you just have to test that it works properly.

``` sh
curl localhost:4000/api/v1/captcha/
```

It will return a random token

``` json
{"token":"OABWNONEOOKXRMMWADPF"}
```

## Create your own JAR

1) Make sure you have **openjdk** or **oracle-jdk** installed, **clojure** and  **leiningen**.

### MacOS

``` sh
brew install openjdk clojure leiningen
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

``` sh
sudo apt install default-jdk clojure leiningen
```

2) Clone the repository and enter the generated folder.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/glosa/glosa-server.git
cd glosa-server
```

3) Run the following command to build a `jar` file.

`lein uberjar`

After this two files should be created in `target/`. We will use the standalone version: `glosa-{version}-standalone.jar`.
